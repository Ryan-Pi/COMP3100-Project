Instructions for Client

Ensure all class files are in the same directory where the command to run it is executed.

Compiled Client can be run using the following command:

java Client -a [algorithm]

An algorithm for scheduling must be selected, where algorithm is one of the following:

stage2, lrr, fc, ff

stage2 is the algorithm designed for Stage 2 of the Assignment
lrr is the Largest Round Robin scheduling algorithm
fc is the First Capable scheduling algorithm
ff is the First Fit scheduling algorithm

e.g.

To run the scheduler using the algorithm designed for Stage 2 of the assignment ("stage2"), the following command is used:

java Client -a stage2
