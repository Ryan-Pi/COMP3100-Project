Instructions for Client

Compiled Client can be run using the following command:

java Client

Additionally, an algorithm for scheduling can be selected by running the following:

java Client -a algorithm

where algorithm is one of the following:

lrr, fc, new

lrr is the Largest Round Robin scheduling algorithm
fc is the First Capable scheduling algorithm
new is the designed algorithm for Stage 2 of the project

e.g. java Client -a new will run the scheduler using the designed algorithm for Stage 2
